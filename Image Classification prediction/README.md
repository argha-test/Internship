# Image Scraping and Classification Project

Images are one of the major sources of data in the field of data science and AI. This field is making appropriate use of information that can be gathered through images by examining its features and details. We are trying to give you an exposure of how an end to end project is developed in this field.
 
The idea behind this project is to build a deep learning-based Image Classification model on images that will be scraped from e-commerce portal. This is done to make the model more and more robust. 

This task is divided into two phases: Data Collection and Mode Bui

Data Collection Phase: In this section, you need to scrape images from e-commerce portal, Amazon.com. The clothing categories used for scraping will be:
-	Sarees (women)
-	Trousers (men)
-	Jeans (men)

Model Building Phase: After the data collection and preparation is done, you need to build an image classification model that will classify between these 3 categories mentioned above. You can play around with optimizers and learning rates for improving your modelâ€™s performance.  

THis is basicaly deep learning project
